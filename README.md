# A collection of `.gitignore` templates that I currently use

This is GitHub’s collection of [`.gitignore`][man] file templates.
We use this list to populate the `.gitignore` template for (.NET and Android)
when creating new repositories and files.

If you would like to know more information about how `.gitignore` files work, how to use them,
the following resources are a great place to start:

- The [Ignoring Files chapter][chapter] of the [Pro Git][progit] book.
- The [Ignoring Files article][help] on the GitHub Help site.
- The [gitignore(5)][man] manual page.
